# DemoApp Project
A demo app project showing a scalable app architecture.

To read more about the architecture, this project's purpose and more insights, please look at the blog posting [Pieces of a scalable iOS app architecture](https://medium.com/@sven.korset/pieces-of-a-scalable-ios-app-architecture).

There is also another [README.md](./DemoApp/README.md) inside of the DemoApp folder which is an example of a typical project documentation file.
