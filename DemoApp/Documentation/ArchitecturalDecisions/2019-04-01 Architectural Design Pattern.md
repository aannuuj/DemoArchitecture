# Architectural Design Pattern

This document describes which architectural design pattern has been chosen.

## Context

With the typical architectural design pattern known as MVC the view controller tends to grow massively and the whole app's structure gets a chaos. This leads to a bad maintainability of the app and a lack of testability.

To prevent this there are design patterns available like MVVM, VIPER, Clean Swift, but this project tries to use a mix of them.
